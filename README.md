# Tinee

URL shortener built with **Mongo**, **Express**, **React** and **Node**. The basic functionality of shortening links and copying them is available to unauthenticated users. Logged-in users have their shortened links automatically saved. Then they can copy, edit or delete them. Although all the core functionalities are complete. I will keep working on that project to add new features such as a search bar and seeds for the Database.
